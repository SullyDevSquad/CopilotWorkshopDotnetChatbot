## Requirements

- Can be implemented in one project, or one solution containing multiple projects

- Create a server that listens for messages from one to many clients, and responds appropriately.

- Server should respond to messages based on what is said. E.g., if i say hello, the server will respond with a greeting. If i ask how are you, it should respond with something.

- Should be a console application, and doesnâ€™t matter how client and server are created. 

 - Not required, but if you want, try to implement refactoring and unit tests coverage.
